# My kakoune config

Currently the repo is missing a plugins/ directory that has all the plugins I use in it, I'm still considering what package management solution to use.

This config assumes several binaries are on your path. On Arch you can run the following command to install dependencies

```
sudo pacman -S kak-lsp xsel
```

For the sake of documentation here's the contents of the folder:

- plugins/kak-harpoon/ - https://github.com/raiguard/kak-harpoon/
