# My kakoune config

Currently the repo is missing a plugins/ directory that has all the plugins I use in it, I'm still considering what package management solution to use.

Also it assumes you have the kak-lsp binary in your PATH. On Arch Linux you can install like it so:

```
sudo pacman -S kak-lsp
```

For the sake of documentation here's the contents of the folder:

- plugins/kak-harpoon/ - https://github.com/raiguard/kak-harpoon/
