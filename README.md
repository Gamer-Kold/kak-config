# My kakoune config

Currently the repo is missing a plugins/ directory that has all the plugins I use in it, I'm still considering what package management solution to use.

For the sake of documentation here's the contents of the folder:

- plugins/kak-harpoon/ - https://github.com/raiguard/kak-harpoon/
